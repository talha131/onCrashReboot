Self - care checklist.

## Objective

Create an infographic about a self-care checklist.

## Background

- Choose calming colors like pastel blues, greens, or soft neutrals to evoke a sense of relaxation and tranquility. Avoid overwhelming patterns or bright, distracting colors.
- Use clear, concise language that is easy to understand.
- Incorporate visually appealing icons or illustrations to represent each self-care activity.
- Organize the checklist in a visually pleasing layout, possibly using columns or sections for different types of self-care activities (physical, emotional, mental, etc.).
- Ensure the text is legible by using a clean, easy-to-read font and appropriate font size.

## Instructions

- Include a title that clearly states the purpose of the infographic (e.g., "Self-Care Checklist").
- Provide a brief introduction explaining the importance of self-care and how the checklist can help individuals prioritize their well-being.
- Clearly list each self-care activity along with a short description or instructions on how to perform it. For example:
    - "Practice deep breathing: Take slow, deep breaths for 5 minutes to reduce stress and increase relaxation."
    - "Go for a walk: Spend 30 minutes outdoors to clear your mind and boost mood."
- Consider adding tips or suggestions for incorporating these activities into daily routines.
- Include a call to action, encouraging viewers to use the checklist regularly and tailor it to their own needs
