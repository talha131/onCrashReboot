Heat Stroke vs. Heat Exhaustion: Know the Difference

## Background

- A warm or hot color scheme (e.g., oranges, reds, yellows) to convey the theme of heat and summer.
- A subtle texture or pattern that evokes a sense of heat, such as a gradient or a sunburst design.

## Key Elements

- A split-screen design or a clear dividing line to separate the two conditions, heat stroke and heat exhaustion.
- Clear headings and subheadings to organize the information and highlight the differences.
- Bullet points or short sentences to make the information easy to scan and understand.
- Icons or simple graphics to illustrate the symptoms and warning signs (e.g., a thermometer for high body temperature, a droplet for dehydration).
- A clear call-to-action (CTA) or a reminder to seek medical attention if symptoms persist or worsen.

### Presentation

- Use a clean and simple layout to make the information easy to read and understand.
- Use visuals to break up the text and make the infographic more engaging.
- Use arrows or other visual elements to connect related information and create a flow.
- Use different font sizes and colors to create a visual hierarchy and draw attention to key points.
- Consider adding a visual element that shows the progression from heat exhaustion to heat stroke, such as a thermometer rising or a warning sign flashing.

## Some potential visual elements to include

1. A graphic of a person experiencing heat exhaustion (e.g., sweating, pale, weak) vs. heat stroke (e.g., confused, slurred speech, high body temperature).
2. A comparison chart or table highlighting the key differences between heat exhaustion and heat stroke.
3. A flowchart or decision tree to help viewers determine whether they or someone else is experiencing heat exhaustion or heat stroke.
4. A map or graphic showing the areas most affected by heat waves or heat-related illnesses.
