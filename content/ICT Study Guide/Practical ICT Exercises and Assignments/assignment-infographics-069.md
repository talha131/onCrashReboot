Pluto - The Dwarf Planet

## Objective

Design an infographic explaining Pluto, its characteristics, and why it is no longer considered a planet.

## Instructions

### Plan Your Infographics

Outline sections for

### Design Your Infographics

Use visuals like,

- A diagram comparing Pluto to Earth (size difference).
- A timeline or chart showing Pluto’s reclassification.
- Add planet and space-themed icons.
- Use dark blues and greys to reflect Pluto’s icy features.
- Use clear, small fonts for details and bold fonts for headings.
- Arrange sections with titles like "Dwarf Planet Pluto" and "The 2006 IAU Decision."

### Add Important Details

Include,

- Facts like "Pluto has 5 moons, including Charon."
- A brief comparison to planets: "Earth is ~150 times bigger than Pluto!"
- Cite any sources used for factual accuracy.

### Final Review & Improvements
