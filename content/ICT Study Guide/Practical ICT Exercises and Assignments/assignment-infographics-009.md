1. Introduction - A light bulb or an open door, symbolizing the initial exposure to a new concept.
2. Practice - A pencil or a practice worksheet, representing the phase where students practice what they've learned.
3. Application - A gear or a toolbox, indicating the application of learned concepts to solve problems or in projects.
4. Mastery - A trophy or a gold star, symbolizing the achievement of mastery over the concept.
5. Extension - A branch or a puzzle piece connecting to another puzzle, representing how mastered concepts are extended to new areas or more complex ideas.
