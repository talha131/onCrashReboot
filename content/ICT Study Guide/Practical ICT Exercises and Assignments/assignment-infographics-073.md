## Instructions

## Plan Your Infographics  

1. **Sections to Include**:  
   - **Introduction**: Quick definition of exam anxiety (use a short sentence).  
   - **Causes**: Brief list of what triggers anxiety (examples: poor preparation, fear of failure).  
   - **Symptoms**: Highlight common symptoms (headaches, inability to concentrate, etc.).  
   - **Tips to Avoid Anxiety**: Include effective strategies to manage stress. Examples:

     - Getting enough sleep and staying healthy.  
   - **Encouraging Quote/Motivation**: End with a positive message about succeeding with proper preparation.  

2. Organize your information logically. Start with the problem (exam anxiety) and follow with solutions (tips).  

## Design Your Infographics  

- Use warm, calming colors like **blue, pastel pink, or light green** to create a soothing effect.  
- Include **relevant icons/images** for each section, like:  
  - A person sweating nervously for the "Symptoms" section.  
  - A calendar for "Set a Study Schedule."  
  - A yoga pose or meditation icon for relaxation tips.  
- Use clear and **readable fonts** (e.g., Arial, Tahoma).  
- Break sections into **clear boxes or panels** to separate content visually.  
- Avoid making the design cluttered—keep extra space between sections.  

## Add Important Details  

- Use **numbers or bullet points** for tips (helps make the content easy to scan).  
- Optional: Add a **small chart or data** (like a percentage of students experiencing exam anxiety).  
- Reference any important source if using specific data/statistics.  

## Call to Action  

- End with a motivational statement like:  
   - “Remember, preparation is the key to confidence. You’ve got this!”  
- Add a reminder: “Reach out to teachers or counselors for more support if needed.”  

## Final Review & Improvements  

- Review for spelling, grammar, and tone consistency.  
- Ensure the information is arranged **by priority** (most important tips first).  
- Double-check visual alignment (icons, images, and text).
