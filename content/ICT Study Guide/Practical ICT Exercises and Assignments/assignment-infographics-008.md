## Objective

Transform the provided data into a visually engaging and informative infographic.

## Instructions

1. **Review the Data:** Carefully analyze the information given below. Understand its structure and how the various elements relate to each other.
2. **Select a Tool:** Choose a digital tool that suits your design needs. Popular options include [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) and [Canva](https://www.canva.com/), but feel free to use any platform you are comfortable with.
3. **Design Your Infographics:** Based on the data, your infographic should take the form of a [**Markov Process**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain#/media/File:Markovkate_01.svg).

### Nodes (States)

1. Lecture - Represented by a chalkboard or a person at a podium, symbolizing traditional teaching methods.
2. Interactive Activity - Illustrated by puzzle pieces or hands-on tools, showing active student participation.
3. Group Discussion - A circle of figures or speech bubbles, representing students engaging in conversation about the material.
4. Multimedia - A video play button or headphones, indicating the use of videos, audios, or interactive software.
5. Independent Study - A book with a magnifying glass, symbolizing self-paced learning through reading or research.
6. Assessment - A checklist or a quiz icon, representing formal evaluations like quizzes or tests.
7. Break/Recess - A coffee cup or a playground slide, indicating downtime or a mental break.

### Edges (Transitions) and Possible Weights

- Lecture to Interactive Activity: 0.6 (There's a significant chance that a lecture will transition into an interactive session to reinforce learning.)
- Interactive Activity to Group Discussion: 0.7 (After engaging with the material hands-on, students are likely to discuss their findings or experiences.)
- Group Discussion to Multimedia: 0.5 (Discussions might lead to multimedia presentations to further illustrate points or provide different perspectives.)
- Multimedia to Independent Study: 0.4 (Exposure to multimedia can prompt students to explore topics further on their own.)
- Independent Study to Assessment: 0.6 (Following self-paced learning, an assessment might be used to gauge understanding.)
- Assessment to Break/Recess: 0.8 (Typically, after an assessment, a break is likely to give students a mental rest.)
- Break/Recess to Lecture: 0.5 (After a break, students might return to a more structured lecture format, though other activities could also follow.)
- Any state to Lecture: 0.2 (From any engagement activity, there's always a chance to return to a lecture for new information or summaries.)
- Any state to Break/Recess: 0.1 (There's a small probability from any activity to transition into an unscheduled break, depending on the class dynamics.)
