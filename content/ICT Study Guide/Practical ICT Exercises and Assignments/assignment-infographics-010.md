## Objective

Transform the provided data into a visually engaging and informative infographic.

## Instructions

1. **Review the Data:** Carefully analyze the information given below. Understand its structure and how the various elements relate to each other.
2. **Select a Tool:** Choose a digital tool that suits your design needs. Popular options include [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) and [Canva](https://www.canva.com/), but feel free to use any platform you are comfortable with.
3. **Design Your Infographics:** Based on the data, your infographic should take the form of a [**Markov Process**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain#/media/File:Markovkate_01.svg).

### Nodes (States)

1. Focused - A book or a student with "thinking" bubbles, representing a state of concentration and engagement.
2. Distracted - A wandering path or a student with a daydream cloud, symbolizing a loss of focus.
3. Disruptive - A small chaos symbol or a broken pencil, indicating behavior that disrupts the learning environment.
4. Regrouping - A circle of figures or a "reset" button, representing the class coming back together to regain focus.
5. Engaged - A group of students with a shared light bulb above, symbolizing high engagement and collaborative learning.

### Edges (Transitions) and Possible Weights

- Focused to Distracted: 0.3 (There's a chance that focused students may become distracted.)
- Distracted to Disruptive: 0.2 (Distracted students might escalate to disruptive behavior.)
- Disruptive to Regrouping: 0.7 (High likelihood of needing to regroup following disruptive behavior.)
- Regrouping to Engaged: 0.6 (After regrouping, students are likely to become more engaged.)
- Engaged to Focused: 0.5 (Engaged students may transition back to individual focused work.)
