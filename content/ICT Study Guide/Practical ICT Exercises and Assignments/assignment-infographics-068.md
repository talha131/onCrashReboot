Discovering Jupiter

## Objective

Design an infographic to highlight Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, and its unique properties like the Great Red Spot and numerous moons.

## Instructions

Find information about,

- Jupiter's size and position in the solar system.
- The Great Red Spot (a massive storm) and its features.
- Fun facts about its moons, such as Ganymede and Europa.

### Plan Your Infographics

Organize these sections in your content

- "Jupiter at a Glance" (dimensions, position, facts).
- "The Great Red Spot" (why it’s famous and important).
- "Interesting Moons of Jupiter" (key facts about some moons).

### Design Your Infographics

- Use symbols like
    - A large planet icon for Jupiter.
    - Small illustrations for its moons.
- Show the Great Red Spot with bold, swirling designs.
- Jupiter’s theme could use orange, white, and red to depict its gas surface and storms.
- Use bold, easy-to-read fonts.
- Create sections or panels (e.g., "Fast Facts," "The Stormy Planet").

### Add Important Details

Add data like,

- "Jupiter has 95 moons!" or "The Great Red Spot has lasted over 300+ years."
- Include references from your research.

### Final Review & Improvements

- Ensure proper alignment and balance in your design.
