- Use a color gradient from cool blues to hot reds to represent star temperatures.
- Choose a clear, modern font for easy reading of scientific terms.
- Create a circular or spiral layout to show the cyclical nature of stellar evolution.
- Use branching paths to show different outcomes for stars of different masses.

### Add Important Details

- Explain key terms like supernova, white dwarf, and black hole.
- Include timescales for different stages of stellar evolution.
- Add information about how elements are created in stars.
- Mention the sun's place in this cycle and its expected lifespan.

### Final Review & Improvements

- Check for scientific accuracy in your explanations.
- Ensure the infographic clearly shows the progression and different outcomes of stellar evolution.
