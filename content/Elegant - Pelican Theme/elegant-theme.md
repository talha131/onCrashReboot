[TOC]

Elegant is a stylish, responsive, and minimal [Pelican](http://getpelican.com/)
theme that looks amazing across all screen resolutions and devices.

Elegant gives meaning to the expression "sand the under side of the drawer."
Every feature and style of Elegant is the result of a long thought process.

What makes Elegant so special?

## Search

Static sites usually do not offer search. Elegant uses [Tipue
Search](http://www.tipue.com/search/)- an open source jQuery plugin, to offer
search for your static site.

There are two search modes.

1. **JSON Mode** Your site pages will be stored in JSON at your server. Tipue
   Search will use AJAX to access it and render search result. You need [Tipue
   Search plugin](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins) to use this
   mode.
1. **Live Mode Search** Tipue Search will fetch your site using Sitemap, index
   it and store it in the visitor's cache. This mode requires [Sitemap
   plugin](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins).

Use JSON mode if you value speed, or have a large site, or don't want to
overwhelm your host server for every search query.

Here is how the search result looks like

![Search result for App Store]({static}/images/elegant-theme_search-result.png)

Search box is part of main navigation menu so that visitor can search from any
page.

![Search box]({static}/images/elegant-theme_search-box.png)

## Live Filter for Tags

Elegant is a minimal theme. Instead of creating separate pages for each tag,
Elegant shows all the tags on a single page. To help visitor find the tags he
is interested in, Elegant offers live filter.

Go to tags page and type your required tag in "Find a tag" search box. Elegant
will automatically filter the list.

For example, this is how my tags page looks like

![Tags view
unfiltered]({static}/images/elegant-theme_tags-live-filter-default.png)

As soon as I type "os", all other tags are filtered out

![Tags view filtered for
"os"]({static}/images/elegant-theme_tags-live-filter-filtered.png)

With live filter, your reader will have no difficulty in picking up his desired
tag from the list, even if your site has hundreds of tags.

## All Categories but with zero clutter

Pelican by default creates a separate page for each category. Themes list all
the articles filed in that category at its page. Elegant takes a different
approach.

It lists all the categories and their articles on the same page. To reduce
clutter and utilise space efficiently, each category and its list of articles
in enclosed in [collapsible
accordions](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/javascript.html#collapse).

Here is how categories appear collapsed

![Categories accordions
collapsed]({static}/images/elegant-theme_category-accordions-collapsed.png)

And this is how they appear uncollapsed

![Categories accordions
uncollapsed]({static}/images/elegant-theme_category-accordions-uncollapsed.png)

Did you notice that categories are listed in ascending alphabetical order and
articles are sorted by their date in descending order?

## Home Page Features

This is the page that visitors see when they open your website. Your chance to
make a good and lasting first impression. Most sites just display a list of
recent posts. Elegant goes the extra mile. Check this out

![Home Page Sample]({static}/images/elegant-theme_home-page-features.png)

You can see two sections here,

1. About me
1. My Projects

There is a third section below these two sections, "Recent articles"

![Recent Articles Section]({static}/images/elegant-theme_recent-posts.png)

### About me

You can write up your own About me section using `LANDING_PAGE_ABOUT` variable
in your configuration. It is a dictionary that has two keys `title` and
`details`. Value of `title` is displayed in the header of the home page, like
in the above example it is "I design and build software products for iOS and
OSX". `details` is the text that appears under "About me" heading.

### Projects

Projects list is read from `PROJECTS`. It is an array of dictionaries. Each
dictionary has three keys, `name` which will have name of your project, `url`
which will have URL of the project, and `description` which will have the
description of the project. You can define as many projects as you want. Here
is an example,

    #!Python
    PROJECTS = [{
        'name': 'Logpad + Duration',
        'url': 'https://github.com/talha131/logpad-plus-duration#logpad--duration',
        'description': 'Vim plugin to emulate Windows Notepad logging feature,'
        ' and log duration of each entry'},
        {'name': 'Elegant Theme for Pelican',
        'url': 'http://oncrashreboot.com/pelican-elegant',
        'description': 'A clean and distraction free theme, with search and a'
        ' lot more unique features, using Jinja2 and Bootstrap'}]

### Recent Articles

Recent articles show last `RECENT_ARTICLES_COUNT` whose default value is 10. It
also has a link to "all posts".

## Mailchimp

Mailchimp has become the preferred newsletter service. Elegant shows a form to
subscribe to your newsletter, above the fold, in the right section of every
article. Increased visibility is said to increase number of subscribers.

![Mailchimp subscriber
form]({static}/images/elegant-theme_subscribe-form.png)

You need to put your Mailchimp form action URL in `MAILCHIMP_FORM_ACTION` in
your configuration file. You can also define `EMAIL_SUBSCRIPTION_LABEL`,
`EMAIL_FIELD_PLACEHOLDER` and `SUBSCRIBE_BUTTON_TITLE` to customize user
experience.

## Collapsible Comments

Readers use scroll bar to track their progress when reading inside their
browsers. Very often comments take up more space than the actual article. When
comments take up more space, it throws the scroll bar proportion off and reader
cannot judge his progress correctly. Hacker News hosted [a
discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6246777) on this topic.

> tons of online articles list comments on the same page, so the scroll bar is
> almost a negative incentive to keep reading. "I've read this much of the
> article and I'm only 1/20th of the way down?"
> [user stops reading, unaware that there's 450 comments and the article is actually pretty short]

Elegant keeps the comments section hidden by default. Reader can hide and
unhide the section by clicking on the comments section.

This is how comments section appear

![Collapsed comments
section]({static}/images/elegant-theme_comments-section-collapsed.png)

It expands when reader clicks on it

![Uncollapsed comments
section]({static}/images/elegant-theme_comments-section-uncollapsed.png)

## Articles Count with every Tag and Category

Readers of an article on your site usually look for other articles on the same
topic. Categories and tags are a way of showing them related articles. Elegant
displays the count of articles that you have written in a category or tag in a
non-intrusive manner.

Every category and tag has the count of articles in superscript. So if you have
written three articles in the C++ category or tag, it will have 3 in the
superscript. This way visitor will know you have written other articles too on
the same topic.

Check out the screenshots,

superscript]({static}/images/elegant-theme_category-superscript-count.png)

![Count of articles that have been tagged is displayed in
superscript]({static}/images/elegant-theme_tag-superscript-count.png)

## Custom 404 Page

Elegant has a custom Error 404 page for your readers.

![Error 404 page]({static}/images/elegant-theme_error-404-page.png)

## Page Title

Elegant follows following format for the `<title>` tag

```
Article title Â· Site Name
```

![Article title is always visible in the
tab]({static}/images/elegant-theme_page-title.png)

Some sites put site title first and article title later in the `<title>` tag.
There is a problem with this approach. When you open too many tabs, browser
delimits tab's title from the end. In such cases, only the first few words or
even letters of the `<title>` are left visible.

If visitor has opened several tabs from your website, all tabs will have "Site
Name..." title. User will need to click on each tab to identify his required
tab from the content. But with Elegant's approach article title will always be
visible, and reader will have less difficultly in identifying the tab he is
after.

Putting site title before the article title increases your site name
visibility. Elegant achieves this by putting site name in the top navigation
bar of every page, where it always stays above the fold.

## Code Style

Elegant uses [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) theme for syntax
highlighting. Line numbers have a different background color so that they
appear distinct from the code. Here is an example

    #!c
    int sample_function (void) {
        printf ("This is a sample function");
        return 0
    }

## Article Subtitle

Pelican lets you define title of your article in the meta data. Elegant adds
subtitle support. Just define `subtitle` in your article's meta data and it
will appear along with your title. Here is an example,

![Article subtitle
example]({static}/images/elegant-theme_article-subtitle.png)

Article subtitle is displayed with the title in every list. To keep it visibly
separate from title, subtitle is enclosed in `<small>` tag. When visible cue
cannot be used, like in the title attribute of html anchor tag `<a>`, a hyphen
is inserted between them.

![Article title and subtitle separated with a
hyphen]({static}/images/elegant-theme_article-subtitle-hyphen.png)

## Elegant - Technical Nitty-Gritty

### License

The license requires that you give credit to me, Talha Mansoor, as the author
of the Elegant theme on every site that uses this theme. I have placed the
attribution in the footer of every page. Do not remove it. If you need to
remove or change the style of the attribution, please get in [touch with
me](http://oncrashreboot.com/#about-me) first.

Along with this attribution clause, Elegant theme is licensed under The MIT
License.

If you use my theme, I would love to hear from you. [Get in
touch](http://oncrashreboot.com/#about-me) and let me know about it. I may link
to your site too.

### Contribute

Front end design is not my strong suite. I must have made some blunders in this
design unknowingly. Please don't let me go away with buggy code.

- File bugs at [Github
  issues](https://github.com/talha131/pelican-elegant/issues)
- Share your ideas about the design in the comments below
- And most of all contribute improvements to [this
  project](https://github.com/talha131/pelican-elegant/)

There are two problem areas that I can think of,

1. Internet Explorer support
1. Web safe fonts. I developed this theme on a MacBook Retina. Although I have
   tried to make sure it looks great on all platforms but it still needs polish

Besides these, there must be other bugs that I haven't noticed yet. I need your
help to hunt them down and make them behave.
