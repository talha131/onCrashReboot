## How It Works

The web uses the Internet to access websites and webpages. It's built on three main technologies:

- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language):** This is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It structures the content on the web.

- **URLs (Uniform Resource Locators):** These are web addresses that point to specific web pages or resources on the web.

- **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol):** This protocol is used for transmitting and receiving information across the Internet.

## Key Features

- **Interactivity:** Websites can respond to user input, allowing for interactive experiences like online shopping, gaming, and learning.

- **Multimedia:** The web supports text, images, audio, and video, making it a versatile medium for conveying information and entertainment.

- **Global Access:** Anyone with an internet connection can access the web, making it a powerful tool for sharing and accessing information globally.

## Importance

The WWW has made information easily accessible to millions of people worldwide. It supports a wide range of activities, including education, research, business, entertainment, and social networking. The web has also enabled new forms of social interaction, communication, and media.
