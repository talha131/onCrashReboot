### Interactive Whiteboards in Math Lessons

In a math classroom, interactive whiteboards can transform traditional lessons into engaging experiences. For example, teachers can use these boards to display interactive graphs that students can manipulate to understand concepts like slope and intercept. This hands-on approach enhances critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

### Online Collaborative Projects in History

Students can use collaborative tools like Google Docs to work on group projects, researching historical events and creating shared presentations. This promotes digital literacy, fosters communication and collaboration, and enhances information literacy as students assess online sources for accuracy.

### Digital Storytelling in Language Arts

In language arts, students can use digital storytelling tools to create their own narratives, integrating text, images, and sound. This activity fosters creativity and innovation, as students design original stories, and supports digital literacy as they navigate different storytelling platforms.

### Science Simulations

Science classes can use online simulations to explore complex concepts, such as ecosystems or the laws of physics. These simulations offer interactive learning experiences that enhance understanding and engagement, promoting critical thinking and problem-solving.

### Social Media for Classroom Discussions

Using social media platforms for classroom discussions on current events can teach digital citizenship by modeling and practicing respectful, informed discourse. This approach also enhances communication skills and helps students understand the impact of digital technologies on society.
