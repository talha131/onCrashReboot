title: Flipped Learning

### Overview

Flipped learning is an instructional strategy that reverses the traditional learning environment by delivering instructional content, often online, outside of the classroom. It moves activities, including those that may have traditionally been considered homework, into the classroom. The main goal is to use class time for engaging students in interactive activities that enhance their problem-solving and critical-thinking skills.

### Key Components of Flipped Learning

·     **Pre-Class Learning:** Students first encounter new material at home, through videos or readings, before the class session. This is the "flipped" part, as it reverses the traditional sequence of lecture in class and homework at home.

·     **In-Class Application:** Classroom time is then used for exercises, projects, discussions, and to deepen understanding of the topic through more direct interaction with the teacher and peers.

·     **Teacher's Role:** In a flipped classroom, the teacher acts more as a guide or facilitator, helping students to apply the concepts they've learned outside of class and engaging them in higher-level thinking tasks.

### Benefits of Flipped Learning

Flipped learning represents a shift in the traditional educational model, emphasizing student engagement and active learning. It leverages technology to deliver content outside of the classroom, allowing for more interactive and personalized learning experiences within the classroom setting.

·     **Enhanced Engagement:** By utilizing class time for hands-on learning, students often become more engaged and active participants in their education.

·     **Personalized Learning:** Students can learn at their own pace outside of class, pausing and rewinding videos or spending more time on difficult readings. This personalizes the learning experience to better meet individual needs.

·     **Efficient Use of Class Time:** Shifting lectures outside of class frees up time for interactive activities, allowing students to practice and apply knowledge with the support of their teacher and classmates.

### Examples of Flipped Learning

1.   A math teacher records video lessons on new concepts for students to watch as homework. During class, students work on problem sets that apply these concepts, with the teacher providing help as needed.

2.   In a history class, students read or watch videos about a historical event at home. In class, they engage in a debate or role-play based on that event, using critical thinking and communication skills to explore the topic in depth.
