### Definition of E-portfolio

An E-portfolio, or Electronic Portfolio, is a digital collection of work. These are a digital way to show and reflect on someone's learning and achievements. It can include writings, photos, videos, research projects, and links to other work on the internet. People use E-portfolios for school, college, or job applications to show their skills and experiences.

It is useful for students, teachers, and professionals to showcase their work, reflect on their growth, and help with their career paths.

### Uses of E-portfolios

#### Showcasing Learning and Achievements

E-portfolios let students and professionals show their best work. It's like a digital folder that holds everything they are proud of and want others to see. This can be helpful for teachers to see how much a student has learned.

#### Reflecting on Growth

E-portfolios are also great for looking back at what you've learned. By adding work overtime, a person can see how much they have grown. It's a way to think about what new things they've learned and what they want to learn next.

#### Job and College Applications

When applying for jobs or college, an E-portfolio can be very useful. It gives a clear picture of what someone can do. It's more than just grades or a resume. It shows real examples of their work.

#### Professional Development

For teachers and other professionals, E-portfolios can help with career growth. They can show their skills, workshops they've attended, and projects they've worked on. This can be useful for getting a new job or a promotion.

### Parts

E-portfolios usually have:

1.     **Projects and assignments**: These are the main pieces of work that someone wants to show off.

2.     **Reflections**: Here, the person talks about what they learned from each project or assignment.

3.     **Goals**: These are the targets or dreams that the person wants to reach in their learning or career.

4.     **Awards and certificates**: Any special recognitions or courses completed can be shown here.

### Need

E-portfolios are great because:

1.     They show off a person's best work in one place.

2.     They help in learning by letting the person think about their work and how they can do better.

3.     They make sharing work with teachers, friends, or even future bosses easy.
