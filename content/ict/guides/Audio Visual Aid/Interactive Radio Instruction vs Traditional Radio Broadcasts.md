title: Interactive Radio Instruction vs Traditional Radio Broadcasts
---

Interactive Radio Instruction differs from traditional radio broadcasts in its focus on active participation, educational design, use of activities for learning, and direct feedback, all aimed specifically at achieving learning objectives for its target audience.

#### Engagement and Interaction

IRI involves listeners in the learning process. It asks them to respond to questions, participate in activities, and engage in discussions based on the broadcast content. This interaction is a key part of the learning process.

These are mostly one-way communications. The audience listens to information, music, or stories without being asked to actively participate or respond.

#### Educational Design

Lessons are specifically designed with educational goals in mind. They follow a curriculum and are structured to teach specific skills or knowledge. Activities and questions are planned to help listeners understand and apply what they hear.

While informative, these broadcasts are not typically designed to meet specific educational standards or follow a curriculum. They are more for general information, entertainment, or news.

#### Use of Activities

Activities are integral to IRI programs. Listeners might be asked to write something down, solve a problem, or discuss a question with others. These activities are directly related to the lesson's objectives.

Any activities listeners might do while listening, such as taking notes for personal interest, are not directed by the broadcast itself. There's no expectation of active participation.

#### Feedback Mechanism

Provides opportunities for immediate feedback. For example, after an activity, the correct answer or approach might be explained, helping learners to assess their understanding right away.

There is usually no direct feedback loop for listeners. If the broadcast is informative, listeners might learn something new, but there's no structured way to check understanding or correct misconceptions.

#### Target Audience

Specifically targets learners, often within a specific age group or education level. The content is tailored to be age-appropriate and relevant to the curriculum they are following.

Aimed at a general audience, which might include people of all ages and backgrounds. The content is more varied and not specifically designed for educational purposes.

#### Purpose

The primary goal is to educate. Whether it's teaching math, science, language skills, or health education, the focus is on learning outcomes.

These can have a variety of purposes, including entertainment, news dissemination, and cultural programming. Education, if it happens, is not usually the main goal.

### Â Example to illustrate the difference

In an IRI program about mathematics for middle school students, the lesson might involve an interactive story that includes math problems. Students might be asked to solve a problem and then perform an activity, like measuring objects around them.

A traditional radio program on mathematics might simply discuss the importance of math in daily life without direct engagement or structured activities for the listener.
