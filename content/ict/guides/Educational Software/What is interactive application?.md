### Definition

An interactive application is a computer program designed to involve users in active participation. This means the application responds to actions made by its users, like clicking a button, typing text, or moving an item on the screen. It's like having a conversation with the computer where you do something, and the computer responds back.

### Key Features

·       **User Input:** Users can enter data or commands that the application will respond to.

·       **Feedback:** The application shows results or reactions based on what the user does.

·       **Multimedia Elements:** Many of these applications use sound, images, and videos to make the interaction more engaging.

### Examples

·       **Educational Software:** Programs that help students learn new topics through quizzes and games.

·       **Social Media Platforms:** Websites and apps where people share posts and communicate with others.

·       **Video Games:** Games on computers or consoles where players control what happens on the screen.

### Importance

Interactive applications are important because they make using computers more engaging and efficient. They can help people learn better, stay connected with others, and enjoy entertainment in a more active way. These applications also encourage users to think and make decisions, which is a valuable skill in both education and everyday life.
