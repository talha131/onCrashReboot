Collaborative projects facilitated by Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools can significantly enhance interactive learning experiences. These projects encourage students to work together, share knowledge, and develop skills essential for the digital age. These projects using ICT tools offer diverse and dynamic ways to engage students in interactive learning.

By incorporating following modes into the curriculum, educators can enhance students' teamwork, creativity, and digital competencies, preparing them for future challenges in an increasingly digital world.

### 1\. Virtual Group Discussions

### 6\. Virtual Labs and Experiments

**Tools:** PhET Interactive Simulations, Labster.

**Description:** Students can conduct scientific experiments or explore mathematical concepts together in a virtual lab environment. This approach allows for hands-on learning experiences without the need for physical lab equipment.

### 7\. Peer Review and Feedback Systems

**Tools:** Turnitin, Google Classroom.

**Description:** These tools enable students to submit work for peer review and provide feedback to their classmates. This mode fosters a culture of constructive criticism and self-improvement, enhancing learning outcomes.
