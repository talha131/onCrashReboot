### Facilitating Collaboration

**Group Projects:** Students can work together on assignments and projects in breakout rooms, even when they're not physically together.

**Peer Learning:** Encourages interactive discussions and peer feedback, enhancing the learning experience.

### Enhancing Parent-Teacher Communication
