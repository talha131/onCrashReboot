title: Facilitating the Flipped Classroom Model with YouTube

### Pre-Class Learning

In a flipped classroom, students first encounter new material outside of class, usually through video content. Teachers can assign YouTube videos as homework, allowing students to learn at their own pace and freeing up classroom time for more interactive activities.

### Customized Learning Experiences

YouTube's vast library allows teachers to curate or create playlists tailored to the lesson's objectives and students' needs. This customization ensures that video content aligns closely with what will be explored or discussed in class.

### Interactive Follow-Up

After watching the videos, classroom time can be used for discussions, projects, or hands-on activities that build on the concepts introduced in the videos. This approach encourages deeper understanding and application of knowledge.

### Supporting Diverse Learning Needs

Videos can be paused, rewatched, and viewed at convenient times, accommodating different learning speeds and styles. This flexibility helps ensure that all students come to class prepared, regardless of their learning preferences.
