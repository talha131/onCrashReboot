### Engaging with History

A history teacher uses a YouTube documentary to introduce a new era. Students watch the documentary at home, coming to class ready to engage in a simulation game that explores the political, social, and economic dynamics of the period.

### Exploring Science Concepts

In a biology class, students watch a series of YouTube videos on photosynthesis before coming to class. During the class, they conduct a lab experiment to observe photosynthesis in action, applying what they learned from the videos.

### Enhancing Math Skills

A math teacher assigns YouTube tutorials on a new algebra concept as homework. In class, students work in groups on problems that require the application of the concept, with the teacher facilitating discussions and providing individual support.
