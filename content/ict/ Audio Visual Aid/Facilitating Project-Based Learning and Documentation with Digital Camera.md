### Documenting Projects

Digital cameras enable students to document their work on projects from start to finish. Photos and videos can show progress, capture experiments, and provide a visual record of their learning journey.

### Supporting Collaborative Projects

In group projects, cameras can be used to collaborate and share findings. For instance, in a geography project, groups can document different areas of a community, sharing their images to create a comprehensive study of local geography.

### Enhancing Presentations

Visuals captured with digital cameras can be incorporated into presentations, making them more engaging and informative. This supports project-based learning by allowing students to present their findings in a dynamic way.
