Media literacy is the ability to find, understand, evaluate, and create media in different forms. It's about being smart with all the media around us like TV shows, internet articles, and advertisements.

This skill helps everyone, especially students, to understand what media is trying to tell us and how it can affect our thoughts and actions. It helps people make sense of the media that surrounds them every day, from videos and articles on the internet to TV shows and advertisements.
