title: About Me
---

Call me Talha; Talha Mansoor. I go by "talha131" at [Github](https://github.com/talha131/) and [GoodReads](https://goodreads.com/talha131). [Email](mailto:talha131@gmail.com) is the best way to reach me.

I work on [Jump Desktop](http://jumpdesktop.com/). It is a remote desktop application for iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows. I play a broad role there; which includes research, product design, engineering, and deployment. I also lend a hand in user support.

I have been working in the field for more than a decade. I do not pigeonhole myself to specific languages or frameworks.

Through the years, I have learned and worked in several programming languages and frameworks. I have built apps for macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android. I am comfortable working in C, C++, Objective-C, C#, Python, and Java.

I took up web development since early 2016 and picked up Go and NodeJS. I have built and delivered apps using ReactJS, Mobx, Redux, and ElectronJS.

Besides the day job, I contribute to open source projects, beta test startup products, and offer consultancy. I work on my physical fitness and read books regularly; to be a stronger and better version of myself!

## What is the intent behind this website?

Years ago I was naive and lacked career counseling. I aspire, these notes and observations, to help green Software developers who are in the same boat as I was.

[Stephen King](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3389.Stephen_King) advises,

> Write with the door closed, rewrite with the door open. Your stuff starts out being just for you, in other words, but then it goes out.

My writings are in the "door closed" stage. I use this website to hone my writing skills and document my notes.
