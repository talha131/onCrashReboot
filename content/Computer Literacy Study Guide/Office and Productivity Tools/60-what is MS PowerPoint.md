   - Built-in templates and pre-designed themes allow users to maintain a consistent and professional look throughout the presentation.  

3. **Text and Fonts**  
   - Includes a wide range of customizable text formatting options, from selecting font styles and sizes to changing colors and alignment.  

4. **Images and Graphics**  
   - Enables insertion of visual elements like photos, clip art, and graphics. Shapes, SmartArt, and diagrams can also be added for better visual representation.  

5. **Animations and Transitions**  
   - Animations allow individual slide elements, such as text and pictures, to appear dynamically.  
   - Transitions create smooth effects when moving from one slide to the next.  

6. **Audio and Video Integration**  
   - PowerPoint supports embedding audio clips or videos directly into slides to enhance multimedia presentations.  

7. **Charts and Tables**  
   - Users can add tables or charts to organize data in a structured way. These tools are ideal for simplifying complex information or showcasing numerical data.
