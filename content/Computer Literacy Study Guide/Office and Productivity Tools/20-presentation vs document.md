### Presentation

A presentation is a visual and often interactive tool that supports verbal communication. It primarily engages audiences during live settings, such as meetings, lectures, or classroom teaching.

1. **Format**

   - Consists of a series of slides, each containing various multimedia elements like text, images, and videos.
   - Typically designed to be displayed on a screen with minimal text for clarity.

2. **Purpose**

   - Used to highlight key points during a speech or lecture.
   - Focuses on visual engagement and conciseness.

3. **Design**

   - Prioritizes aesthetics with large fonts, bullet points, and visual elements like charts or photos.
   - Employs minimal text to avoid overwhelming the audience.

4. **Interactivity**
   - Offers interactive features like animations, transitions, and audience participation tools.
   - Suitable for live or virtual presentations, enhancing engagement.

### Document

A document is more formal and detailed, designed primarily for thorough reading and reference. It presents information in a structured, text-focused format.

1. **Format**

   - Text-based with elements such as paragraphs, headings, and structured layouts.
   - May include supporting visuals like images, charts, or tables for elaboration.

2. **Purpose**

   - Used for providing in-depth information, records, or instructions.
   - Serves as a reference or resource for readers.

3. **Design**

   - Prioritizes readability and logical flow, with detailed formatting like captions, page numbers, and text alignment.
   - Organized into sections for clarity and convenience.

4. **Interactivity**
   - Typically static, meant for reading rather than interaction.
   - Digital versions may include hyperlinks or cross-references for easy navigation.
