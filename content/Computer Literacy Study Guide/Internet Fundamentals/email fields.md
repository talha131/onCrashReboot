## Common Fields Used in Emails  

Emails are an essential tool for communication, and understanding the different fields in an email is important for crafting effective and professional messages. Below is a detailed explanation of the common fields used in emails.  


### 1. **To**  

- The "To" field is where the sender places the primary recipient's email address.  
- This recipient is considered the main audience for the email.  

**Example**: Sending an assignment to a teacher.  


### 2. **Cc (Carbon Copy)**  

- The "Cc" field is used to send a copy of the email to additional recipients who should be aware of the message but are not the primary audience.  
- Recipients in the Cc field can see each other's email addresses.  

**Example**: A teacher emailing a student and copying the parents for transparency.  


### 3. **Bcc (Blind Carbon Copy)**  

- The "Bcc" field is similar to Cc but keeps recipientsâ€™ email addresses hidden from others.  
- Useful for sending the same email to multiple people while maintaining privacy.  

**Example**: An administrator sending notices to all staff members without revealing individual email addresses.  


### 4. **Subject**  

- The subject line provides a one-line summary of the email's purpose.  
- A clear and precise subject helps recipients understand the email's content at a glance.  

**Example**: *Subject: Meeting Schedule for Next Week*.  


### 5. **Body**  

- The body contains the main content of the email.  
- It includes the details of the message, usually structured with a greeting, main points, and a closing.  

**Example**: Explaining the project deadline or sharing instructions in detail.  


### 6. **Attachments**  

- Attachments allow the sender to include additional files, such as documents, images, or PDFs, with the email.  
- Recipients can download and access these files.  

**Example**: Attaching a lesson plan or an assignment submission.  


### 7. **Signature**  

- The signature is a pre-configured closing section that usually includes the sender's name, contact details, designation, or company information.  
- It can also include other professional elements like social media links or disclaimers.  

**Example**:  
  *Regards,*  
  *Jane Smith*  
  *Teacher, Greenfield High School*
