## How Does the WWW Work?  

The WWW functions through several core technologies:  

1. **Web Browsers**  
Web browsers, such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, enable users to access and interact with websites. Browsers act as the interface between users and the World Wide Web.

HTTP is the protocol used to transfer data between web servers and browsers. It ensures that webpages load properly on users' devices.  

3. **URLs (Uniform Resource Locators)**  
Every webpage has a unique URL, which acts as the address for locating a specific web resource. For example, *https://www.example.com* is a URL.  

4. **HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)**  
Webpages are created using HTML, which determines how content is displayed, including text, images, links, and multimedia.  

5. **Web Servers**  
Web servers store website data and respond to requests from web browsers, delivering the requested content to users.
