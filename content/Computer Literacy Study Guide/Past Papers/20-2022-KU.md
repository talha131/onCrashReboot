### Describe the uses of storage devices in the education.

{{< callout type="error" >}}
The question is overly broad and lacks specific context - it should specify whether to focus on educational settings, teaching methods, or learning processes. A more focused version would be "Describe the uses of storage devices in educational settings."

### Define bar and types of bars in MS Office.

{{< callout type="error" >}}
The question is ambiguous and poorly worded - it fails to specify whether it refers to toolbars, chart bars, or other bar elements in MS Office applications. Furthermore, "bar" alone is too vague as a standalone term in the context of Microsoft Office.

### What is the role of Massive Open Online Courses during Coivd-19 and how Mock-Courses can support you as a teacher in future?

{{< callout type="error" >}}
The paper contains a typographical error in "Coivd-19". The correct spelling is "COVID-19" (Coronavirus Disease 2019).
{{< /callout >}}

{{< callout type="error" >}}
The term "Mock-Courses" appears to be an error. The question likely intended to reference "MOOC" (Massive Open Online Courses). 
{{< /callout >}}

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
This redundancy and incorrect terminology in an official examination paper is concerning. **However, during examinations, students should focus on answering the question's intent rather than its technical errors.**
