### 1. Speed

Modern computers are capable of executing billions of instructions per second, thanks to advanced processors and high-speed memory. Tasks that once took hours can now be completed in milliseconds, enabling quick calculations, fast processing of large datasets, and seamless usage of applications.

**Example**: Real-time gaming, stock market analysis, and high-speed internet browsing are possible due to the impressive computational speed of modern systems.

### 2. Storage Capacity

With advancements in technology, the storage capacity of computers has expanded significantly. Modern computers combine large internal storage (in terabytes) with cloud-based and external storage options. This makes it possible to store vast amounts of data, applications, multimedia, and backups.

**Example**: Cloud services like Google Drive and Dropbox allow unlimited external storage for files, while SSDs and large-capacity hard drives provide quick file access locally.

### 3. Connectivity

One of the standout features of contemporary computers is their ability to connect seamlessly to the internet and other devices, enabling a wide range of functions and remote access to resources. This connectivity supports activities like browsing the web, accessing cloud services, video conferencing, and connecting with IoT (Internet of Things) devices.

**Example**: Computers integrated with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth provide wireless connectivity for internet access, syncing devices like printers, or connecting with smart home equipment.

### 4. Multitasking

Modern computers are designed to handle multiple processes simultaneously without significant performance drops. They allow users to run several applications at once, such as editing documents, browsing the web, and streaming a video, offering greater productivity.

**Example**: A designer can run graphic editing software, a web browser, and email clients concurrently to streamline their workflow.
