Computer memory plays a crucial role in storing and accessing data. Two primary types of memory exist: volatile and non-volatile. Each serves a distinct purpose in computer operations.

## Volatile Memory

Volatile memory temporarily stores data while the computer is powered on. It's called "volatile" because the stored information disappears when the power is turned off.

**Key characteristics:**
- Requires constant power to maintain data
- Provides fast read and write speeds
- Commonly used for temporary storage of active programs and data

**Example:** Random Access Memory (RAM)

{{< callout type="info" >}}
RAM allows quick access to data, enhancing system performance by reducing the need to fetch information from slower storage devices.
{{< /callout >}}

## Non-Volatile Memory

Non-volatile memory retains stored data even when the power is turned off. This type of memory provides long-term storage for files, applications, and the operating system.

**Key characteristics:**
- Retains data without power
- Offers slower read and write speeds compared to volatile memory
- Used for long-term data storage

**Examples:** Hard Disk Drives (HDD), Solid State Drives (SSD), USB flash drives

## Purpose of Volatile Memory

Despite its temporary nature, volatile memory serves critical functions:

1. **Speed**: Provides rapid data access for currently running programs
2. **Multitasking**: Enables smooth operation of multiple applications simultaneously
3. **Efficiency**: Reduces the load on slower, non-volatile storage devices
