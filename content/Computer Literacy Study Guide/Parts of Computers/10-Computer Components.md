Computers are complex machines composed of various components working together. This guide breaks down these parts into simple categories, making it easier to understand how a computer functions.

## Processing Components

These parts handle the computer's main operations:

1. **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**: The "brain" of the computer.
2. **Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)**: Handles visual data for games and videos.
3. **Motherboard**: Connects all parts of the computer.

## Memory and Storage

These components store data:

1. **Random Access Memory (RAM)**: Temporary storage for active tasks.
2. **Hard Drive (HDD) or Solid State Drive (SSD)**: Long-term storage for files and programs.
3. **Removable Storage**: Portable devices for data transfer and backup:

   - USB flash drives
   - External hard drives
   - Memory cards

4. **Optical Storage**: Reads and sometimes writes to CDs, DVDs, or Blu-ray discs.

## Input Devices

These allow users to interact with the computer:

1. **Keyboard**: For typing text and commands.
2. **Mouse**: For navigating the screen.
3. **Microphone**: For audio input.

## Output Devices

These display or present information from the computer:

1. **Monitor**: Displays visual information.
2. **Speakers**: Produce sound.
3. **Printer**: Creates physical copies of documents.

## Power and Cooling Systems

These keep the computer running and prevent overheating:

1. **Power Supply Unit (PSU)**: Provides electricity to all components.
2. **Heat Sink**: Absorbs and dissipates heat from the CPU.
3. **Fans**: Help circulate air to cool components.

## Connectivity Components

These allow the computer to connect to networks and other devices:

1. **Network Interface Card (NIC)**: Enables wired internet connection.
2. **Wi-Fi Adapter**: Allows wireless internet connection.
3. **Bluetooth Adapter**: Enables wireless connection to other devices.
4. **USB Ports**: Connect various external devices and peripherals.
