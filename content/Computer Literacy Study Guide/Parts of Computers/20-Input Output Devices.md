## Dual-Function Devices: Touchscreens

Touchscreens serve as both input and output devices:

- **Input**: Users can interact with the device by touching or gesturing on the screen.
- **Output**: The screen displays visual information to the user.

Touchscreens are prevalent in smartphones, tablets, and many modern laptops.

## Specialized Mobile Device Components

Mobile devices often incorporate additional specialized I/O components:

1. **Vibrating Motor**:

   - Provides haptic feedback through vibrations.
   - Used for notifications, alerts, and touch response.

2. **LED Indicator Light**:
   - Serves as a simple output device.
   - Used for notifications, battery status, or other visual alerts.
