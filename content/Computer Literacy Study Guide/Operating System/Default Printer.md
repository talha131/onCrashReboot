### Definition of a Default Printer

A default printer is the primary printer selected by the operating system for printing tasks unless another printer is specifically chosen by the user. It acts as the automatic destination for print jobs, ensuring a seamless printing experience.

### Advantages and Purpose

Setting a default printer simplifies the process of printing documents, images, or files. It eliminates the need to select a printer each time a document is printed. This feature is particularly useful in environments with multiple printers, as it helps streamline operations. For individual tasks, users have the option to manually choose a different printer when needed.

### How to Set a Printer as the Default

Follow these simple steps on a Windows operating system to set a printer as the default:

1. **Navigate to Settings**  
   Open the Start Menu and select "Settings." Then choose "Devices."

2. **Access Printers & Scanners**  
   In the Devices menu, select "Printers & Scanners" from the left-hand toolbar.

3. **Select the Desired Printer**  
   From the list of installed printers, locate the printer to be set as the default. Click on it to reveal more options.

4. **Manage and Set as Default**  
   Click the "Manage" button, and then select the "Set as default" option. This action designates the selected printer as the default choice for all printing tasks.

### Important Notes

- **Automatic Printer Selection**: Some systems have an option to let Windows manage the default printer automatically. This means the default printer will be changed to the last printer used in the current session. This option can be found in the "Printers & Scanners" settings.
- **Verifying Default Status**: The default printer is marked by a checkmark in the printer list under "Printers & Scanners."
