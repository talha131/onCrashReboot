## Using Native ZIP Compression

Windows natively supports the ZIP format, allowing users to compress files without additional software. Here is how to create a ZIP file:

1. Select the files or folders to be compressed.
2. Right-click the selection, navigate to "Send to," and choose "Compressed (zipped) folder."
3. A new ZIP file appears in the same location, containing the compressed contents.

This method is ideal for quickly reducing file sizes for email attachments or archiving purposes.

## Utilizing 7-Zip for Advanced Compression

For more advanced compression options, tools like 7-Zip offer a powerful alternative. 7-Zip is a free, open-source application supporting a variety of formats (e.g., 7z, TAR). Here are the steps to compress files using 7-Zip:

1. Download and install 7-Zip from the official website.
2. Right-click the file or folder to be compressed.
3. Select "7-Zip" from the context menu, then choose "Add to archive."
4. Configure preferred settings (e.g., format, compression level), then click "OK" to create the compressed file.

7-Zip provides flexibility and options for different levels of compression.

## Mounting ISO Files

Windows also supports mounting ISO filesâ€”optical disc image files commonly used for software distribution or backups. Mounting an ISO file makes it accessible as a virtual drive. To mount an ISO:

1. Locate the ISO file using File Explorer.
2. Right-click the file and select "Mount."
3. Access the mounted drive through "This PC" to view the contents.

These features allow educators to efficiently manage digital content, ensuring optimal file management and sharing.
