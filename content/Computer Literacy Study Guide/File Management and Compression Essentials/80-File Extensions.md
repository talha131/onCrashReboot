## Why File Extensions are Used

File extensions play a vital role in identifying the file type, allowing the operating system to determine which applications can open and process the file. For example, a .docx extension indicates a Microsoft Word document, guiding the system to use Word to open it.

## Information Provided by File Extensions  

- **File Type**: Identifies the digital format, such as a text document, image, or spreadsheet.
- **Associated Application**: Suggests which software is suitable for opening and editing the file.
- **File Behavior**: Specifies how the file interacts with the operating system and various applications.

## Protection Against Malware  

Understanding file extensions aids in recognizing potentially harmful files. Some extensions, like .exe (executable files), may contain malware if received unexpectedly or from unknown sources. By being aware of common and safe extensions, users can avoid opening risky files.

Be cautious of double extensions (e.g., filename.doc.exe), which often disguise malicious software.
