Choosing the right image format is crucial for optimizing quality, storage, and usability. PNG, TIFF, JPEG, and WebP are popular image formats, each with distinct capabilities and ideal uses.

## PNG (Portable Network Graphics)

- **Capabilities**: PNG is a raster image format that supports lossless compression, meaning images retain their quality after compression. It also supports transparency, making it useful for images that require a see-through background.
- **Best Usage**: Ideal for web graphics, logos, and images that need to maintain high quality and transparency. Often used in digital media where lossless quality is essential.

## TIFF (Tagged Image File Format)

- **Capabilities**: TIFF files provide excellent image quality due to their support for lossless compression and multiple layers. They are highly versatile and can store high-color-depth images, including grayscale and color.
- **Best Usage**: Commonly used for professional photography, desktop publishing, and image archiving, where quality preservation is critical, such as in high-quality scans and print media.

## JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)

- **Capabilities**: JPEG utilizes lossy compression, significantly reducing file size while retaining acceptable image quality. However, repeated editing and saving can degrade image quality.
- **Best Usage**: Optimal for photographs and realistic images used in digital photography, web content, and social media, where balance between size and quality is necessary.

## WebP

- **Capabilities**: Developed by Google, WebP supports both lossy and lossless compression, enabling smaller file sizes with retained quality. It also supports transparency and animation.
- **Best Usage**: Suitable for web use, WebP helps reduce page load times by compressing images efficiently without compromising quality, making it ideal for websites focusing on performance optimization.
