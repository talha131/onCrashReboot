## Differences Between Vector and Raster Images

### Vector Images

- **Composition**: Made up of paths defined by mathematical formulas, which describe geometric shapes like lines, curves, and polygons.
- **Scalability**: Highly scalable without losing quality, making them ideal for logos and graphics that require resizing.
- **Resolution**: Resolution-independent, meaning they maintain clarity at any size.

### Raster Images

- **Composition**: Made up of pixels, each containing color information to form the entire image.
- **Scalability**: Less scalable as enlarging the image beyond its original size results in pixelation and loss of quality.
- **Resolution**: Resolution-dependent, with quality determined by the number of pixels (e.g., 300 DPI).

## Example Formats and Applications

| **Vector Image Formats** | **Description**          | **Applications**            | **Usage**                             |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **.svg**                 | Scalable Vector Graphics | Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape | Web graphics, logos                   |
| **.eps**                 | Encapsulated PostScript  | Adobe Illustrator           | Print graphics, illustrations         |
| **.ai**                  | Adobe Illustrator file   | Adobe Illustrator           | Complex graphics, professional design |

| **Raster Image Formats** | **Description**                  | **Applications**      | **Usage**                       |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **.jpg or .jpeg**        | Joint Photographic Experts Group | Adobe Photoshop, GIMP | Photographs, web images         |
| **.png**                 | Portable Network Graphics        | Adobe Photoshop, GIMP | Web graphics, transparency      |
| **.gif**                 | Graphics Interchange Format      | Adobe Photoshop, GIMP | Animations, simple web graphics |
| **.bmp**                 | Bitmap                           | Microsoft Paint       | Simple images, screen graphics  |

## Usage of Each Format

Choosing between vector and raster image formats depends on the specific needs of the project.

Vector images offer scalability, ideal for graphics that need resizing without quality loss, while raster images excel in detailed, color-rich context like photography. Understanding these differences helps in selecting the right format for optimum image quality and usability.

### Vector Image Usage

- Preferred for designs that require resizing without quality loss, such as logos, icons, and typography.
- Ideal for print materials due to high-quality output at various sizes.

### Raster Image Usage

- Suited for detailed and complex images like photographs, where color gradations are important.
- Common in digital photography and web images that do not require resizing after creation.

## Comparing Vector and Raster Images

Vector and raster images represent two fundamental types of digital graphics, each with unique characteristics and uses. The table below illustrates their differences, providing examples, applications, and usage contexts.
